# jsonToRSS
A simple, customizable python script to convert JSON data to an RSS feed, with a focus on podcast RSS.

I will first develop this project for a more specific, personal need. 

I will then add more customization options so the script is easier for others to use for their specific needs.


More information will follow here.
